\question WEEK4 QUIZ
\begin{parts}
\part
Professor Enigma left a series of clues regarding the location of a missing artifact. The artifact can only be in one place. If the artifact is in the library, then it is hidden behind a bookshelf. If the artifact is not in the library or it is buried in the garden, then the statue in the backyard is made of bronze and the statue in the front yard is not made of marble. If the artifact is in the attic, then the statue in the front yard is not made of marble. If the artifact is not buried in the garden, then the statue in the backyard is not made of bronze. The artifact is not in the library. Using rules of inference, determine where the missing artifact is located.

Detective Sherlock has to solve the case of a stolen painting. The painting can only be in one place. If the painting is in the art gallery, then it is displayed on the east wall. If the painting is not in the art gallery or it is hidden in the vault, then the security alarm is deactivated and the security cameras are not turned off. If the painting is in the study room, then the security cameras are not turned off. If the painting is not hidden in the vault, then the security alarm is activated. The painting is not in the art gallery. Using rules of inference, determine where the stolen painting is located.

Captain Adventure is on a quest to find a legendary treasure chest. The treasure can only be in one place. If the treasure is on the island, then it is buried in the sand.
