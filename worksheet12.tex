\question Show that the sequence $a_{n}$ is a solution of the reccurence relation $a_{n}=-3a_{n-1}+4a_{n-2}$ if:

\begin{parts}
\part
$a_{n}=0$
\vspace{9in}

\part
$a_{n}=-4^n$

\end{parts}

\question For each of these lists of integers, provide a simple formula or rule that generates the terms of an integer sequence that begins with the given list. Assuming that your
formula or rule is correct, determine the next three terms
of the sequence
\begin{parts}
\part 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, 38, 51, 66, 83, 102,…
\vspace{2in}
\part 7, 11, 15, 19, 23, 27, 31, 35, 39, 43
\vspace{2in}
\part 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000, 1001, 1010, 1011,…
\vspace{2in}
\part 2, 4, 16, 256, 65536, 4294967296,…
\vspace{2in}
\end{parts}
\question Prove that the closed-form solution of the recurrence relation $a(n) = 2a(n-1) + 3^n$ for $n \geq 1$ is $a(n) = 2^n + (n+1) * 3^n - (n+2)$.
