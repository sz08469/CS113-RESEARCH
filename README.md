## UNIVRSITY COURSES AND THEIR IN DEPTH ANALYSIS:
## HARVARD UNIVERSITY:
 ### PRE CLASS WORK:
•	Pre-class mini-lectures, readings, and problems before each class
•	CS20 at Harvard is taught as a “flipped class”. What this means is that the traditional class lecture is provided to students as a video that they must watch prior to class so that students can spend the class time engaged in active problem solving.
•	Prior to each class students are provided preparatory video and readings and some pre-class work and/or questions to help them. The questions can be in form on online quiz.
•	First 20 minutes of class will discuss those readings and videos.
 ### IN CLASS WORK:
•	A few problems are distributed to the class on paper
•	Class breaks up into groups of four, each at its own table, and each group solves first problem on its whiteboard
•	When everyone in the group is confident he or she can explain the solution, a member of the course staff goes to the table and calls on one member of the group to explain the solution
•	The staff member either points out problems with the solution and leaves the group to improve their solution, or checks off the solution and allows the group to proceed to the next problem.
