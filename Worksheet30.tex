\begin{questions}

\question
Encrypt the message DO NOT PASS GO by translating the letters into numbers, applying the given encryption function, and then translating the numbers back into
letters.
\begin{parts}
    


\part f(p) = (p + 3) mod 26 (the Caesar cipher)
\newpage


\part f(p) = (3p + 7) mod 26
\newpage

\end{parts}



\question Decrypt these messages encrypted using the shift cipher
f(p) = (p + 10) mod 26.

\question
Encrypt the message \texttt{GRIZZLY BEARS} using blocks of five letters and the transposition cipher based on the permutation of $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\}$ with $\sigma(1) = 3$, $\sigma(2) = 5$, $\sigma(3) = 1$, $\sigma(4) = 2$, and $\sigma(5) = 4$. For this exercise, use the letter \texttt{X} as many times as necessary to fill out the final block of fewer than five letters.
\newpage

\question
Decrypt the message \texttt{EABW EFRO ATMR ASIN}, which is the ciphertext produced by encrypting a plaintext message using the transposition cipher with blocks of four letters and the permutation $\sigma$ of $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$ defined by $\sigma(1) = 3$, $\sigma(2) = 1$, $\sigma(3) = 4$, and $\sigma(4) = 2$.
