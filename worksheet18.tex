\question
Use strong induction to show that every positive integer
can be written as a sum of distinct powers of two, that is,
as a sum of a subset of the integers $2^0 =1, 2^1 =2, 2^2 =4$,
and so on. [Hint: For the inductive step, separately consider the case where k + 1 is even and where it is odd.
When it is even, note that $(k + 1)/2$ is an integer.]

\question Suppose you begin with a pile of n stones and split this
pile into n piles of one stone each by successively splitting a pile of stones into two smaller piles. Each time you
split a pile you multiply the number of stones in each
of the two smaller piles you form, so that if these piles
have r and s stones in them, respectively, you compute
rs. Show that no matter how you split the piles, the sum
of the products computed at each step equals \( \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \).

\question 
Prove by strong induction that Breaking a chocolate bar with $n \geq 1$ pieces into individual
pieces requires n – 1 breaks.
