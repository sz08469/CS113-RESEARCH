\fbox{\fbox{\parbox{5.5in}{\centering In our exploration of cardinality, we will learn how to determine the size of a set, even when dealing with infinite sets. We will study different types of cardinal numbers and will use our previous knowledge  of bijections and one-to-one correspondences to determine a sets's cardinality. Happy Learning!}}}
