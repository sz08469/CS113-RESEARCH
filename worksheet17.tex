\fbox{\fbox{\parbox{5.5in}{\centering Today, we will learn another form of induction known as Structural Induction. It  is used in mathematical proofs to establish the validity of statements about recursively defined objects or structures. It is particularly useful when dealing with data structures such as lists, trees, graphs, or any other recursively defined entity. Happy Learning!}}}

\section{Structural Induction}
To prove using Structural Induction do follwoing steps:
\subsection{Basis Step:}
Show that the result holds for all the elements specified in the basis step of recursive definition.
\subsection{Recursive Step:}
Show that if the statement holds for all the elements used to construct new elements in the recursive step of definition, then the statement holds for the new elemenets as well.
