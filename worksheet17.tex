\fbox{\fbox{\parbox{5.5in}{\centering Today, we will learn another powerful form of induction known as Strong Induction. Strong Induction, also known as Complete Induction or Course-of-Values Induction, is a variant of mathematical induction that allows us to establish the validity of statements about natural numbers or other well-ordered sets. Happy Learning!}}}

\question 
Given \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), define \(a_{n}\) recursively as follows:
\[
a_{n} = 
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } n = 0 \\
3, & \text{if } n = 1 \\
2a_{n-1} - a_{n-2}, & \text{if } n \geq 2 \\
\end{cases}
\]

Prove for all \(n \geq 0\), \(a_{n} = 2n + 1\).
